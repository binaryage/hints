If you're on iOS 6, you may have wondered where the podcasts section of the Music app went. Well, it seems that if you have the Podcasts app made by Apple installed on your device, then the podcasts section of the Music app disappears. If you don't like the Podcasts app, or find that you seldom use it because of the interface, you can remove the app and the podcasts section of the Music app will reappear, almost if by magic. Now, you can again enjoy listening to your podcasts through the Music app in a playlist or intermixed with other audio clips if you so desire.

If you have any questions about the Podcasts or Music apps, please leave a comment below!
