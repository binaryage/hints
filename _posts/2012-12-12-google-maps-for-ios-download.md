The new version of Google Maps for iOS is here! <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8">You can head over to the App Store and get it right now!</a>

The interface has a very Google+ like experience and the actual navigation system emulates the simplified interface trend that Apple Maps has continued. The result is a simplified experience with directions that actually get you to where you want to go. And...the best part is public transportation which is back on iOS devices in a mobile app!

If you are having issues downloading the app, I would suggest first visiting <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8">this link</a> on your computer to download the app. Then on your iOS device, I would search for a Google product, scroll down to the bottom where it says "Developer Info" and then scroll down to the bottom of that to download "Google Maps".

Hope you are able to download the app and enjoy the newly added Google Maps app. I know I will be using this a lot in the upcoming holiday season!
