Lion Tweaks has been updated to version 2.0.1 to support Mountain Lion! Lion Tweaks is the popular software developed by Frederik Wiker and is available for download <a href="http://ifredrik.com/applications/index.html">here.</a> It allows you to tweak settings in Lion and Mountain Lion that were removed from Snow Leopard. Features such as: changing the iCal leather to aluminum, coloring the finder sidebar, and enabling airdrop on older hardware are all available using this product. You can also do things such as: show the user library folder, enable the 2D dock, and enable TRIM support on Lion.

EDIT: It seems that Lion Tweaks is not changing the skins on iCal/Calendar or Contacts/Address Book. <a href="http://hints.binaryage.com/change-mountain-lion-calendar-and-contacts-app-to-aluminum-skin/">Here</a> is a quick fix for that.

If you have any questions about the tweaks listed in Lion Tweaks 2.0.1, please leave a comment below! Happy tweaking!
