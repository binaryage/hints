Here is a quick tutorial on something most people may or may not have noticed. In iOS 5, Apple included a new feature that allows you to view hourly forecasts for the next 12 hours. In the Weather App on iOS 5, simply tap either the word "hourly" right below the city name, or tap on any of the days of the week. This tweak will allow you to view hourly forecasts but only for the current timeframe. You cannot view prior forecasts or future forecasts past 12 hours. Hope you found this tweak amusing and useful!
