Sometimes an application on your computer becomes unresponsive. In order to force quit an application, simply select Force Quit under the Apple menu. Here is a screenshot:

Alternatively, you can simply press the key combination CMD-Option-Escape to pull up this menu. Once you have the menu open, simple select the application and click Force Quit.
