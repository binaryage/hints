Here is a simple tutorial on how to find your MAC address on your iPhone.

Step 1) Go to Settings > General > About. The tidbit of information you are looking for is actually called the "Wi-Fi address" on your device. Use that identifier for whatever network device that may need it.

That was easy! Hope this helps you guys!
