In iOS 5.1, Apple added a new feature to Mobile Safari. You can simply tap and hold on the New Page icon for a list of your recently closed tabs. This feature is similar to Chrome's CMD-Shift-T feature and desktop Safari's CMD-Z feature to open up tabs you may have accidentally closed. This feature is very helpful and it is now on iOS 5.1!
