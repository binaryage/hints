One of the new features of iOS 6 is the new sharing feature which quickly allows you to share any content you desire with anyone, at the push of a button. Apple has designed the new interface to make sharing easier than ever and has also given us the methods (Facebook and Twitter) to do so easily. You can now select from the following: Mail, Message, Twitter, Facebook, copy, Add yo Favorites. All of these options used to be in a list like dialog that would pop up and it would be very inconvenient to do so. Now with the modal that pops up over the content that you are viewing, you can easily select from one of the 6 choices and share your content with everyone!
