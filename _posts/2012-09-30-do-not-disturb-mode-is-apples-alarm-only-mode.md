In what seems to be a new feature of iOS 6, Apple now provides a "Do Not Disturb" mode for iOS devices which allows you to not be alerted visually or by vibration of any email, phone call, or text message that you might receive. However, it does still act as an alarm. This feature may be welcome for people who would like to go to sleep without being distracted every five minutes with notifications, but it is also unwelcome for many people in business because they expect their phones to remain silent for the duration of a meeting. Regardless, this new feature is a welcome one, especially personally for me because me old "dumb phone" had this feature and I was worried my new iPhone 5 would be lacking.
