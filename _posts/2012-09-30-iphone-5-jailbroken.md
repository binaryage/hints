Well known iOS jailbreaker, chpwn, posted an image about a week ago of the iPhone 5 running iOS 6 with Cydia on the home screen. We all know what that means, yep, the iPhone 5 running iOS 6 was jailbroken! However, don't get your hopes up just yet. This is just proof of concept, the actual jailbreak hasn't been released to the public and probably won't be until the release of iOS 6.0.1 because they usually wait for Apple to make bug fixes before proceeding with the jailbreak. So sit back and watch the show, soon you'll be able to have your iPhone 5 running a jailbroken version of iOS 6!

If you have any questions or speculations about when the iOS 6 jailbreak is coming out, leave a comment below!
