From as early on as iOS 4 up until the current iOS 5.0.1, this problem has found its way into all versions of the iPhone. After ending a conversation with a friend, you may find yourself unable to hang up or your phone may even freeze at the conclusion of a call. To fix these problems, you will have to follow these steps below.

Step 1) Hard reset your phone by holding down the home and the sleep/wake button at the same time until you see the Apple logo appear.

Step 2) If that didn't work, you will have to restore your iPhone using this guide <a href="/how-to-restore-your-iphone-ipod-touch-or-ipad/">here</a>. Be sure to set up your iPhone as a new phone, if you set it up from a backup, you will inevitably have the same problems.
