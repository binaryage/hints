Wondering where that long rumored Facebook integration into Mountain Lion is? It certainly has been mentioned by Apple several times in their list of updates included in their newly launched Mountain Lion. As it turns out, the new Facebook integration won't be coming out until the Fall, most likely October. This may be sad news for some, but don't worry, you'll be posting status updates from your Mac Notification Bar in no time at all. Stay tuned!
