On Mac OS X, there are several hotkeys for the function buttons (Fn) that bring up a quick application such as Dashboard or Mission Control. To activate them, you simply press the corresponding Fn key, either F4 or F3 respectively. This is a very nice, sleek feature that Apple has provided, however, if you simply wanted to view a Dashboard widget for a brief moment, you still have to press the Fn key twice. To speed this process up, you can simply hold down the key to invoke the application and when you lift up, the application goes away back to the current application that you were previously in. This is a quick hints that may/may not speed up your average workday.
