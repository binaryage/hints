Even though Apple just release iOS 6.0.1 to the general public, they have also just pushed out the iOS 6.1 beta to the developers. So far, the most notable change has been the inclusion of a button labeled "Report a problem" in the Apple Maps app. This is a welcome feature and a step towards recreating a whole new maps infrastructure. There are a bunch more minor changes as well as fixing issues with Passbook and the Lockscreen. If you have any questions, feel free to post below!
