Google has updated their iOS version of their popular Gmail app. The app now fills up the entire screen on iPhone 5s and still provides the same great interface to interact with your email accounts. Consequently, you can now view more content on your device and the awkward black bars that plagued the top and bottom of this app are now gone.

If you have any questions or concerns about the update, feel free to leave a comment below!
