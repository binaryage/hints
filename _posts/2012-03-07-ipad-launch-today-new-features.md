Today, the iPad 3, possibly referred to as the iPad HD, will be announced to the public today in Apple's media event. With its name in speculation, one thing is pretty well known, the iPad will come with a high resolution, retina display that has a pixel density up to four times as much as its current iteration. There have also been several reports that the iPad will not have a home button, although most of those claims have rescinded. As with any other relese, we can not be sure until it is officially announced, so stay tuned for the coverage of the event! Presumably, the pre-orders will start the day after the event so mark your calendars for March 8th, becuase you should be able to pre-order your shiny new iPad on that date.

Stay tuned and discuss the new iPad in the comments below!
