The latest update to the Developer Preview version of Mountain Lion enables Automatic App downloads similar to iOS. All you have to do is buy and download an app on any of your Macs and it will download to any other Mac that is logged in to the same Apple ID.

This may be a welcome feature for some users who have multiple Macs, however, the question arises, will Apple force you to download updates without your consent? Hopefully this will be an option. Post your thoughts in the comments below.
