Here is a quick tip to improve your speed with using iOS apps. In most native apps that have a scrollview, you can simply tap the top of the screen around where the clock is to instantly scroll to the top of the page. This allows you to quickly get back up to the top to use the address bar and the search bar. Outlined below, you can actually touch anywhere on the red line for this to work.
