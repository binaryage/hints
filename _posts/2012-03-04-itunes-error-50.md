If you are receiving the following error then follow the instructions below to resolve the issue:

"There was an error downloading your purchased music. An unknown error occurred (-50)."

Step 1) If you have any of the following, you will have to configure them to allow certain domains through.
	* Firewalls
	* Web Accelerators
	* Ad Filters
	* Virus Protection Software

Step 2) Follow the documentation from each of the listed applications to fix the issue. Allow these domains to go through to iTunes:
	* itunes.apple.com
	* ax.itunes.apple.com
	* albert.apple.com
	* gs.apple.com

If you are receiving this error because of this message: "Error (-50)" when downloading purchased videos, then
