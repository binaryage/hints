The iPhone sometimes has an eror during syncing called iTunes Error 13019. The fix to this error is very different from what you would think. Follow the steps below to get started:

Step 1) Plug in your device into your computer and open iTunes.

Step 2) Select your device under Devices in the sidebar on the left.

Step 3a) Navigate to the Music tab and deselect the Voice Memos Playlist. 

Step 3b) Alternatively, you can simply delete this playlist from iTunes on the left sidebar, however, the playlist might come back in the future and cause this problem again. 

Step 4) Press the Sync button in the bottom right and your iPhone should now sync without a problem!

If you have any questions about the process or any comments to make, please post them in the comments below!
