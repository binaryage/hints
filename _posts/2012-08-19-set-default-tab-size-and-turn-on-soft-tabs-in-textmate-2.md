Tired of annoying hard tabs instead of soft tabs in TextMate 2? Here is a simple tutorial on how to fix that and we will also teach you how to set the default tab size.

Open TextMate 2 and go to Preferences. Click on the Variables tab and all you have to do is add a few new variables. To set the default tab size, make a new variable called "tabSize" and set it to whatever you want (I always do 2). Then, make a second variable called "softTabs" and set that to "true" (if and only if you want soft tabs of course).

That's it! If you have any questions, please leave a comment below!
