This is a small feature that many people probably do not know about. On the iPhone or any iOS device with Panorama mode, you can simply tap on the white arrow in the middle of the screen to change the direction that you sweep when in this mode. Now, you can take panoramas going from right to left in addition to the ones you can take going from left to right. Handy!
