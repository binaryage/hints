Tonight, the App Store officially hit the 25 billion downloads milestone. For many, this was an opportunity to win a $10,000 USD iTunes gift card if you were the lucky person who downloaded the 25 billionth. We should know in a few days who exactly won the prize and I'm sure in the near future, we will be talking about the next milestone that Apple will hit, soon after the iPad 3 comes out.
