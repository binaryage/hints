Adobe has released an all new beta version of Photoshop CS6 available now for free from Adobe Labs. The release is available in English and Japanese and the full version of the product is expected to be released within the next year. Adobe hopes that the beta program will allow them to iron out potential bugs in their final product before the actual release.

There are several new features in the CS6 version of Photoshop including a new interface, Camera Raw 7 plugin, and a noticeable performance increase because Photoshop CS6 will use Adobe's new Mercury Graphics Engine with uses the GPU instead of relying primarily on the CPU.
