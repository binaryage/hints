As you all know, Apple has removed Google Maps from iOS 6 in favor of their own maps software. You all also know that the new app has failed and with its continued bad press, Apple has openly come up with alternatives for users of iOS 6. Check out the Map Apps featured section of the iOS App Store. Apple has added this section for you to use an alternative app such as Waze or even MapQuest until they can fix their broken Maps app.

What do you guys think of this move by Apple? Will this suffice until they can fix their Maps app in a later release? Let us know in the comments below!
