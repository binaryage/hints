The new Safari 6 Developer Preview that was available for developers shortly after the WWDC conference includes many new features from Safari 5.1 and 5.2. The move to Mountain Lion also means that Safari 6 is closer to the iOS version of Mobile Safari than ever before. Features such as iPad style tabs, iOS style expose tab navigation, and tabs that sync between iOS and Safari 6 are all welcome features being added to this version. Be aware that this is a developer preview so crashing will occur often and it is best to stay on Safari 5.2 which can be found <a href="http://hints.binaryage.com/new-safari-5-2-beta-update-3-download/">here.</a>

Anyways, if you want to give the new Safari 6 Developer Preview a try, you can download it from <a href="http://ge.tt/6WY3kyI/v/0?c">here.</a> No guarantees of how well it will run on your system.

If you have any questions about the upcoming features of Mountain Lion, iOS 6, or Safari 6, please leave a comment below and I will do my best to answer your questions!
