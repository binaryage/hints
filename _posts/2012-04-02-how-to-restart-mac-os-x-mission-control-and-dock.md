Here is a quick tip that not all users may know. If you are having problems on your Mac with the Dock or the Mission Control feature, you can simply restart both by using Terminal. To open Terminal, simply go to Applications > Utilities and select Terminal. At the prompt, type <code>killall Dock</code> just as you have in previous versions of OS X. 

Hope this helps! Post a question or comment down below!
