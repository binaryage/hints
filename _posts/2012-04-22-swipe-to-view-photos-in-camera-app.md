On iOS 5, Apple has added a new feature that allows you to easily view your photos that you just took from the Camera app. Most people know about the icon in the bottom left corner of the Camera app that allows you to view your photos, however, there is an even faster method. You can simply swipe to the left in the Camera app and you will instantly view your recent photos! Here is a picture:
