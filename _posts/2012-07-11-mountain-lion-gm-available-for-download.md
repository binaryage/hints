Apple has recently pushed out the Gold Master developer version of OS X Mountain Lion to developers. That means we can be expecting the Mountain Lion official release shortly hereafter. When the new Mountain Lion comes out, it will cost only $20 and will be available via the Mac App Store.

If you can't wait, you can download the GM version <a href="http://imzdl.tumblr.com/">from here.</a>
