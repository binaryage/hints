Here is a quick guide on how to enable AirPrint on your Windows machine assuming you have iOS 5 or greater.

1) Go <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=317147&d=1324647356">here</a> to download the latest files that you need in order to enable AirPrint.

2) Double click on the "AirPrint_Installer.exe" application and then click on "Install AirPrint Service".

3) Run the "AirPrint iOS 5 FIX - 32Bit.reg" or "AirPrint iOS 5 FIX - 64Bit.reg" (depending on what type of os you have installed) to install the current version for iOS 5.

4) Again, open "AirPrint_Installer.exe" and double check that "Service Startup" is set to "Auto" and click "Start".

5) Restart your computer, you are almost done.

NOTE: You may need to enable the guest account on your computer by going to Control Panel > User Accounts > Manage Another Account > Turn the Guest Account on. In the AirPrint_Installer.exe, you may need to choose the guest account that you just enabled. Click "Enable Guest Account" and then click "Update." Again, you have to restart.
