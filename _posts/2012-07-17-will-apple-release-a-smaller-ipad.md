There have been a few articles recently that speculate that Apple may be developing a new iPad. The new iPad would be around 7-8 inches in diagonal screen size which would place it right inbetween the iPhone and the current iPad. If you want to read more about the rumors, here are a few articles: <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-03/here-comes-nexus-7-nightmare-the-ipad-mini.html">Bloomberg</a>and the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304141204577506471913819412.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Wall Street Journal</a>.

Both are credible sources, but do you believe them?

Let's start a discussion in the comments below! I, for one, believe that Apple will indeed come out with this speculated iPad becuase there is a large enough market for such a device. What do you think?
