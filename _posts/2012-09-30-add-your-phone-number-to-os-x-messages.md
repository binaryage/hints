With the new iOS 6 and Mac OS X 10.8.2, you can now send and receive iMessages from your phone number to and from your computer! This is a very desirable feature because it makes iMessage more like Google Voice. Now, you don't have to look around and find your phone; it's the perfect solution for lazy people!

If you've been having problems with getting this new feature to work, follow the steps below to troubleshoot your problem.

Step 1) Log out and log back into iMessage on your iPhone. You can do this through Settings > Messages > iMessage, slide it to off. Wait a few seconds, then slide back to on. Then tap on Send & Receive click on your Apple ID at the top, then click Sign out. Again, wait a few seconds, and then sign in again.

Step 2) If that doesn't work, a simple restart of your computer may also do the trick! Your Apple ID settings on your phone and your computer need to sync up, so restarting your computer will do this for you. 

If either of these methods above worked for you, I'd like to hear all about it in the comments below! If they didn't, what ended up working for you? Let us know in the comments!
