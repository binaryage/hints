Here is a relatively short tutorial on how to burn ISO images in Mac OS X using the built in Disk Utility app. For some, this might be trivial, however for most people, this can be a daunting task. Don't worry, we're here to help.

Step 1) Insert a blank disc into your computer's optical drive located on the side of your computer.

Step 2) Open Disk Utility located in Applications > Utilities or found by using Spotlight by pressing CMD-Spacebar.

Step 3) Select File > Open Disk Image and navigate to the ISO that you want to burn. On the left side of Disk Utility, you should now see the ISO that you want to burn. Select it and click the Burn button at the top of Disk Utility in the toolbar. Follow the instructions to burn the disk!
