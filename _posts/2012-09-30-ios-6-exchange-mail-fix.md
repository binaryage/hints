Some people have reported issues using Exchange Server 2007 and 2010 on iOS 6. A temporary fix has been discovered and here are the steps to follow to start receiving your Exchange email again:

Step 1) Go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar > Fetch New Data and make sure it is set to Push.

Step 2) Go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar > click on your Exchange account > click on Days to Sync > change it to a different setting (something different from what you have now, you can change it back later).

Step 3) Go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar > click Show > change to a different value (again, something other than what you have now).

Step 4) Reboot your iOS 6 device. 

Step 5) Test out Exchange by sending yourself an email. Push should be working and you should be able to send and receive emails from your account now!
