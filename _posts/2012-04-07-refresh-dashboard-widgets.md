Here is another short tip on something you may or may not have used before on Mac OS X. Ever had a stuck or frozen Dashboard widget? Well this tip can fix that. Simply place your mouse over the widget and press CMD-R, the frequent Refresh keyboard shortcut. A short animation will play signifying the restarted widget and the data should be reloaded.

Hope this helps!
