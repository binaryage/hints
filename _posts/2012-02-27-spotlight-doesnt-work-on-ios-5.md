If your iPhone's spotlight feature fails to show any results or only shows a limited view of results, follow the steps below to fix this issue with spotlight.

Step 1) On your iDevice, go to Settings > General > Spotlight Search. Uncheck Mail.

Step 2) Restart your iDevice by holding down the home button and the sleep/wake button.

Step 3) Spotlight should now work, but will not search email. To reenable email, simply go back to Settings > General > Spotlight Search and recheck the mail option.

Step 4) If the proposed solution above did not work, try the same thing again but uncheck all the spotlight options, restart, and then recheck them.

Step 5) Last but not least, sync your iDevice with iTunes. For some odd reason, the act of syncing the device causes the spotlight issue to go away.
