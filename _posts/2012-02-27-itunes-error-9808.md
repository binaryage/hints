Ever received this error while trying to access the good ol' App Store or the iTunes Music Store itself? Well, on Windows here is one solution that just might save you.

This works for sure on Microsoft XP, and will most likely work on Windows Vista and Windows 7 also. Post in the comments if it does not, or if it does!

Step 1) In Internet Explorer, go up to Tools > Internet Options. 

Step 2) Go to the last tab, Advanced, and scroll down to the Security section. 

Step 3) Make sure "Check for server certificate revocation (requires restart)" is unchecked (5th box down).

Step 4) Access the iTunes Store as usual and hopefully it will fix the iTunes 9808 error. 

Step 5) Purchase and/or celebrate connecting to the iTunes store!
